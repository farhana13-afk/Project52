Welcome to WhiteHatJr, your number one source for all things coding. I am Farhana Ashiq a student from WhiteHatJr. We're dedicated to giving you the very best projects, with a focus on creativity, color, and learning.
<br>
<br>
This project focuses on making the easiest and most fun way to make origami figures. Instead of searching the web, this one website can give you many fun animals to choose from. They have step-by-step tutorials to follow and create cute figures. 
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy my website as much as I enjoy creating them for you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me.
